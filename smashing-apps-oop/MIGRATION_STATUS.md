## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### AI-Core Integration

#### Article Smasher AI-Core Adapter
Created `articleAICoreAdapter.ts` that bridges the original Article Smasher interface with AI-Core:

**Key Features**:
- ✅ `generateTopics()` - AI-powered topic suggestions
- ✅ `generateKeywords()` - Keyword research with metrics
- ✅ `generateOutline()` - Structured article outlines
- ✅ `generateContent()` - Full article generation
- ✅ `generateImagePrompts()` - AI image prompt creation
- ✅ `testPrompt()` - Prompt testing functionality

**Integration Method**:
```typescript
// Old way (original)
import articleAIService from '../services/articleAIService';

// New way (AI-Core)
import articleAICoreAdapter from '../services/articleAICoreAdapter';
const articleAI = useArticleAIService(); // Returns adapter
```

#### Task Smasher Integration
Task Smasher uses the existing shared services which will be gradually adapted to AI-Core in future iterations.

### Import Path Fixes
- Fixed 100+ import paths to match new directory structure
- Corrected mismatched quotes in 14 files
- Fixed dynamic imports in contexts

## 📝 Known Issues & Warnings

### Build Warnings (Non-Critical)
1. **Large Bundle Size**: 1,009 kB (293.58 kB gzipped)
   - Consider code-splitting for optimization
   - Not blocking deployment

2. **Dynamic Import Warnings**
   - `globalSettingsService.ts` and `imageService.ts` have mixed static/dynamic imports
   - Does not affect functionality
   - Can be optimized later

### Potential Runtime Issues to Test
1. **Image Generation**: Requires API key configuration
2. **Prompt Management**: May need initial prompt seeding
3. **Usage Tracking**: Verify it works with AI-Core
